# 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge

## About the Team
Our team brings together a diverse set of backgrounds and skills, including two South Korean military veterans with leadership and problem-solving expertise and a hearing-impaired member providing valuable insights on accessibility and adaptability. United by our shared interest in projects that make a positive social impact, we approach challenges from multiple angles, leveraging our varied perspectives and experiences to achieve common goals. We offer a welcoming, communicative environment where new members can learn, grow, and collaborate with a motivated, adaptable, and mission-driven team.

## About the Challenge
Planetary seismology missions struggle with the power requirements necessary to send continuous seismic data back to Earth. But only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful! Instead of sending back all the data collected, what if we could program a lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data we care about? Your challenge is to write a computer program to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic quakes within the noise!
