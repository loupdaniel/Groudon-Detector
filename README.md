# 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge Cleveland - Groudon Detector

## About the Team
Our team brings together a diverse set of backgrounds and skills, including two South Korean military veterans with leadership and problem-solving expertise and a hearing-impaired member providing valuable insights on accessibility and adaptability. United by our shared interest in projects that make a positive social impact, we approach challenges from multiple angles, leveraging our varied perspectives and experiences to achieve common goals. We offer a welcoming, communicative environment where new members can learn, grow, and collaborate with a motivated, adaptable, and mission-driven team.

## About the Challenge
Planetary seismology missions struggle with the power requirements necessary to send continuous seismic data back to Earth. But only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful! Instead of sending back all the data collected, what if we could program a lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data we care about? Your challenge is to write a computer program to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic quakes within the noise!

## Objectives
Detecting seismic activity on Mars and the Moon is essential for understanding planetary geology and enhancing space exploration. Our goal is to develop a model to identify seismic anomalies in planetary data to identify earthquakes. We also want to determine the patterns of seismicity on the Moon and Mars that we hypothesize can be divided into foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks similar to Earth.

## Steps
### Step 1 üåò
For **Lunar data**, the data is relatively sufficient than Mars. For **Mars data**, we used IQR Method to overcome the problem of insufficient data. We trained scalar function to scale the datasets before we put them into our model.

### Step 2 üåó
We used **LSTM Autoencoder** to detect anomalies in time series data.

### Step 3 üåñ
We visualized the detected anomalies in a graph, and highlighted the anomalies with a red marker for analysis.

### Step 4 üåï
We outputted the **CSV files** from the data that detected anomalies on the graph.

## Research Results

### Pattern Analysis üåç
* Our analysis revealed patterns in lunar and Martian seismic activities that appear to follow Earth-like sequences of foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks
* The detected patterns, while similar in sequence, showed unique characteristics specific to each celestial body

### Lunar Seismic Characteristics üåò
#### Data Analysis
* Benefited from relatively sufficient data compared to Mars
* Successfully applied LSTM Autoencoder without requiring additional data processing techniques
* Clear pattern recognition achieved through comprehensive dataset

#### Detection Results
* Multiple seismic sequences identified through anomaly detection
* Reconstruction MAE showed expected right-skewed distribution
* Threshold determination proved effective for identifying significant events

### Martian Seismic Analysis üåì
#### Data Processing
* Successfully implemented IQR method to address data insufficiency
* Maintained data integrity while generating usable training sets
* Scaled datasets effectively before model implementation

#### Key Findings
* Plot 1 demonstrated a medium-intensity precursor, followed by a major event and smaller subsequent activity
* Plot 2 revealed a sequence of three minor events preceding a major seismic event, followed by continued vibrations
* Pattern consistency suggests reliable detection despite limited data

## Conclusions and Future Directions üéì
